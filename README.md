Participant Selection for the HGSFP winter school 2019
======================================================

The code in this repository contains a record of the details of
how we selected participants for the HGSFP winter school 2019.

It is based on a tutorial notebook for the participant selection for Python in Astronomy 2017 by Daniela Huppenkothen, which is available at https://github.com/dhuppenkothen/PyAstro17ParticipantSelection.
