    "# Participant Selection for the HGSFP Winter School 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the participant selection procedure for the HGSFP Winter School 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disclaimer: This Jupyter notebook is based on a tutorial notebook for the participant selection for Python in Astronomy 2017 by Daniela Huppenkothen, which is available at https://github.com/dhuppenkothen/PyAstro17ParticipantSelection. Vast portions of the present notebook have been adopted from there, and some parts were retained verbatim. We are very thankful to Daniela Huppenkothen and the pyastro17 SOC for providing their insightful notebook and for making their selection process transparent and comprehensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "For privacy reasons, this notebook uses data that has been completely randomized within categories, thus no candidate is individually identifiable (and names and other markers of identity have been removed completely).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, the results of this procedure do not exactly mirror the results of our participant selection: the candidates in our data set here are random combinations that follow the input distributions of our real data, and not actual people. We felt it was important to be both transparent about and accountable for our selection procedure. This notebook is designed to give the reader an overview of the procedure from start to finish, and we have added our reasoning for certain choices where those were part of the selection. The notebook is also an example of what this kind of procedure can look like, and thus a kind of tutorial for other conference organizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our procedures for admitting participants is constantly evolving as we tweak, make mistakes and learn from them. If you have any suggestions for future procedures (or more generally have thoughts about participant selection), we would love to hear from you either via an issue on this repository, or an e-mail to **winterschool2019@physi.uni-heidelberg.de**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Asking The Right Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Designing the application form was perhaps the most difficult task, and it is at this stage that conference organizers will already want to put serious thought into the goals of the workshop and the ideal mix of participants to achieve those goals. It should be obvious, but it bears repeating: you will only be able to include categories in your selection that you actually ask for! \n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-selection\n",
    "Excluding speakers, we have 52 spots for the meeting.\n",
    "Our participant selection proceeded in two parts. In the first part, \n",
    "we rejected candidates outright who were either (1) duplicate entries or (2) candidates who had informed us that they would not be able to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two spots were reserved for the HGSFP representatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we pre-selected the organizing committee, who needs to be present at the school. Thus, a total of 8 participants (6 organizers, 2 representatives) were pre-selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then anonymized our applicant pool by replacing names and other identifying information with a unique identifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Participant Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "For the remaining 52 - 8 = 44 slots, we used `Entrofy` to optimize our participant set based on a set of well-defined criteria on which the organizers agreed. It's worth noting here that this discussion took place _before_ performing the selection, which then depended entirely on the _goals_ for the selection and was independent of the input data set. \n",
